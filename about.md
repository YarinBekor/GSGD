## About the Project

Gaussian See, Gaussian Do is a novel approach to 3D semantic motion transfer using Gaussian Splatting. This project aims to revolutionize how we handle motion transfer between 3D models while maintaining semantic consistency.

### Technical Details

- Implementation using PyTorch
- Real-time processing capabilities
- Advanced motion capture integration
- Semantic understanding algorithms
